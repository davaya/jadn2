# What Is Information Modeling


> An information model is a representation of concepts, relationships, constraints, rules,
> and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse.
> The advantage of using an information model is that it can provide sharable, stable, and
> organized structure of information requirements for the domain context.
> An information modeling language is a formal syntax that allows users to capture data
> semantics and constraints.


> In the objected-oriented approach, the fundamental construct is the object, which incorporates both
> data structures and functions. The building blocks in the O-O model are object classes, attributes,
> operations, and associations (relationships.)
