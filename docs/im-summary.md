# What Is Information Modeling

There is a critical distinction between the object-oriented **approach** and an object-oriented
**programming language**:
Every hardware CPU, virtual machine, and programming environment, simply by processing data,
has object classes, attributes, operations and associations:

* **Literals** are constant values (sequences of bytes or characters) suitable for storage and transmission.
* **Objects** hold variable values in a processing environment.
* Input translates literals into object values.
* Output translates object values to literals.
* An object has an information value with operations supported by a processing environment, but
loading, processing and saving information does not require an OOP language.

Example:
* The DEC PDP-11, a 1970's era minicomputer, has memory, registers, operations, and I/O.
Even its 8- and 16-bit values operated on by machine-level instructions are objects:

The semantic meaning of an information value is independent of any literal values used
to represent it.
